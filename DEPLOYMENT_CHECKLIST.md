- [ ] Configure project settings

### 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] Add any required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Test with environment variables locally

### 3. Deploy
- [ ] Trigger initial deployment
- [ ] Verify build success
- [ ] Test deployed application

### 4. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Test all features on live site
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Set up custom domain (if needed)
- [ ] Configure analytics (optional)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run start

# Deploy with Vercel CLI
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Ensure no TypeScript errors
4. Check for missing environment variables

## Performance Notes

- Build size: ~127 kB (First Load JS)
- Static pages: 3 pages pre-rendered
- API routes: 1 dynamic route
- Optimizations: Enabled by default in Next.js 15
